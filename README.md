# The Tool

***

#### What is The Tool?

The Idea behind The Tool would be to create an AI Based system to instantly translate messages from speakers of modern foreign languages into the First Language of the recipient using The Tool.

#### How would this work?

In simple terms the idea of The Tool would work as follows

- Recording the message from the speaker
- Using AI to identify the language spoken
- Using AI Speak the translated language back to the user

#### Who is the targeted audience?

The target audience would be from people such as politicians and tourists to allow easy communication with others from other countries, without the need from an intermediary person having to manually and slowly translate the message back to the users.

### Deciding on how the project will be made

#### Deciding between Compiled and interpreted languages [[1]](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/fastest-programming-language/)

All High-Level Programming Languages are human readable, which is then translated into machine readable code so it can be executed. The way this informaition transfer occurs effects the speed and flexibility of the code.

Interpreted languages are read through an interpreter which then translates the code. Conversely, compiled languages allow the machine to directly understand code without an interpreter.
