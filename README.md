# The Tool

***

#### What is The Tool?

The Idea behind The Tool would be to create an AI Based system to instantly translate messages from speakers of modern foreign languages into the First Language of the recipient using The Tool.

#### How would this work?

In simple terms the idea of The Tool would work as follows

- Recording the message from the speaker
- Using AI to identify the language spoken
- Using AI Speak the translated language back to the user

#### Who is the targeted audience?

The target audience would be from people such as politicians and tourists to allow easy communication with others from other countries, without the need from an intermediary person having to manually and slowly translate the message back to the users.

### Deciding on how the project will be made

#### Deciding between Compiled and interpreted languages [[1]](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/fastest-programming-language/)

All High-Level Programming Languages are human readable, which is then translated into machine readable code so it can be executed. The way this informaition transfer occurs effects the speed and flexibility of the code.

Interpreted languages are read through an interpreter which then translates the code. Conversely, compiled languages allow the machine to directly understand code without an interpreter.

#### The speeds of different programming languages

Comparing the speeds of programming languages would be a difficult task. Fortunatly people like [Niklas-heer](https://github.com/niklas-heer) have developed a way of producting the data we are looking for. 

on 2023-02-05 they generated the following [data](https://niklas-heer.github.io/speed-comparison/pages/2023-02-05T185235.html)

From this data we can see that C, Nim, and C++ are the top 3 fastest programming languages we can use.

#### What are the use cases for these languages?

Now we know the programming coding Languages are C, Nim and C++ we can figure out what each of these specialise in.

C is primarily used for system programming in embbeded systems and applications requiring close to hardware control and efficency, such as Operating Systems and compliers. 

Nim is used for writing software in a variety of application domains, ranging from web applications to kernels.

C++ Is primarily used for diverse applications such as system software, embedded systems and high-proformance applications. 

#### So which one will help us most?

C++ Seems to be the most useful, it having a wide range of users who use it will allow for easy support from a wide-range of people. C++ Being a compiler-based programming language will allow for fast compile and execution times, seen in the evidence previously and has the bonus of being designed for system software and embedded systems. Which is exactly what I want this software to end up like.
